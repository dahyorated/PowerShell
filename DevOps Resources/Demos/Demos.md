# Demos Folders
This folder contains "safe" invocations of some of the DevOps scripts.

In this cotnext, "safe" means that the results do not have any impact on the DevOps branches and folders used for development and releases.
- All branches created must begin with "Demo/".
- All folders must be under the "Demo" folder.
- All modified artifacts such as variable groups must have "Demo" or "Test" as a suffix.
